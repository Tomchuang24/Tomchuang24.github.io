I am currently in the [Civil Engineering](https://cee.technion.ac.il/), [Israel Institute of Technology ](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/), under the supervision of Professor. [Sagi Filin](https://cee.technion.ac.il/en/members/filin/).<br>
I received my Bachelor's degree and MSc degree in [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) in Wuhan, China, where I was a member of the 2013 Leading Engineering Project in Geomatics Engineering and 2017 Project in Navigation, Guidance and Control. 

# Research
My research interests mainly lie in Multi-sensor intergration, Autonomous Mapping and **3D modelling and Geometry Analysis**. <br> I started my research as working with GNSS/INS/LiDAR and mobile mapping at 2017. Indeed, my most recent publication involves in neighbor definition and robust measures (tensor and L1-PCA) for classification and 3D modelling of complex shapes (trees).
